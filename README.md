# ModBot
A mod tool for Wayfarer's Pub

#### 1. How do I use this?
First clone the repository, then run `npm install` and it should set everything up for you. After that, `gulp watch` will build the `*.js` files into `modbot.js` and run `nodemon modbot.js`.
To actually use the bot, you will need to add it to your Discord server and leave it running somewhere.

#### 2. And in the server, how do I use it?
`!modxp help` will give all the commands related to the XP tracking.

#### 3. Can I reuse it? Change it? Do whatever?
Yes. Just credit me, but do whatever.
